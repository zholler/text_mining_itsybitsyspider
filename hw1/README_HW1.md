### Economics dictionary (Harvard IV)
We ran the two methods and returned the top 10 speeches. The frequency count method and tf-idf methods do not return exactly the same presidents and years however there is not a noticeable difference. Both methods return some of the same presidents multiple times. 

### Military dictionary (Harvard IV)
Once again we ran the two methods and returned the top 10 speeches. Both methods give us results that match up with the timing of the first world war and the second world war. Overall the results match up a little less than they do using the economics dictionary.

We calculated the overall sentiment of a speech by multiplying the frequency counts of each word by its respective valence score. We then summed up all weighted frequency counts for each speech. 

The most positive speech: Carter, 1981

The least positive speech: Roosevelt, 1942


We also did the same thing using the tf-idf matrix. This produced drastically different results.

The most positive speech: Adams, 1825

The least positive speech: Roosevelt, 1905
