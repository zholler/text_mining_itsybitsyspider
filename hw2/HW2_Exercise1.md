##Exercise 1
After generating the tf-idf matrix (X) for the presidental speech corpus we performed singular value decomposition. Since no clear pattern arose from the plot of singular values we experimented with different number of singular values to keep. In the end, we decided to keep 40 out of 236 to keep and computed X^.

In the next step, we chose the 4 most recent Republican and Democrats presidents and alaysed the average cosine similarity within and across speeches made by Republicans and Democrats. Using average cosine similarities based on the X matrix showed that while the similarity whithin democrats (0.11) and whithin republicans (0.12) are somewhat higher than the similarity across democrats and republicans (0.09), the similiarities are relatively low in general and the difference does not seem substantial. Using X^ on the other hand reveals clearer patterns. It seems that while the similarity whithin democrats (0.41) and across democrats and republicans (0.46) are not substantially different the similarity whithin republicans (0.68) is much higher.
